                <p >If you are learning web development, you will come across terms like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    These are often called the building blocks of the Web.These three tools dominate web development. 
                    Every library or tool seems to be centered around HTML, CSS, and JS. 
                    So if you want to become a web developer, you need to learn them well.
                    HTML and CSS are actually not technically programming languages; they're just page structure and 
                    style information. But before moving on to JavaScript and other true languages, you need to know 
                    the basics of HTML and CSS, as they are on the front end of every web page and applicat.
                    You'll also discover that websites are mostly built from these three languages.</p>

              <p>Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, 
                and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. 
                It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the 
                GNU General Public License (GPL).This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Python programming language starting 
                from basic conceopts to advanced concepts. This tutorial will take you through simple and practical approaches while 
                learning Python Programming language.</p>

            <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
              Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. 
              James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already 
              a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</p>
